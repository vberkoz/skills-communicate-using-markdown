# Basics of JavaScript:
## What is JavaScript?
JavaScript is a versatile, high-level programming language primarily used for web development. It enables interactive and dynamic functionality on websites, allowing for real-time updates, form validation, animations, and more. As a vital part of the web stack, it runs on the client-side in web browsers, making websites engaging and user-friendly. Its versatility extends to server-side development through frameworks like Node.js. In essence, JavaScript powers the interactive elements that users interact with on the web, making it an essential tool for modern web development.

## Explain the differences between var, let, and const.
**var**, **let**, and **const** are variable declaration keywords in JavaScript.
1. **var** has function scope and can be re-declared and updated within its scope. It's function-scoped, not block-scoped.
2. **let** and const were introduced in ES6 (ES2015). **let** is block-scoped and allows reassignment, making it useful for variables that can change.
3. **const** is also block-scoped but does not allow reassignment after declaration, making it suitable for constants or values that should not be changed.

In summary, prefer **let** for variables that need to change, and **const** for constants. Avoid using **var** due to its function scope and potential for unintended behavior.
